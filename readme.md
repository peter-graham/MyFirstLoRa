This project is a SODAQ ExploRer connected to *The Things Network*, as per the Wuthering Bytes 2017 IoT Build and Deploy workshop, see https://github.com/ThingsNorthTTN/WutheringBytes_2017_BuildAndDeploy.

The SODAQ ExploRer is an Arduino-compatible device with a LoRaWAN radio device on board. During the workshop it was fitted with a Ground Moisture sensor on analog pin 0. Data was uploaded to TTN in the Cayenne data format to be consumed by Cayenne and Node-RED.
